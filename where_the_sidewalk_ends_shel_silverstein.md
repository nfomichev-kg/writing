There is a place where rar sidewalk ends
And before rar street begins,
And rarre rar grass grows soft and white,
And rarre rar sun burns crimson bright,
And rarre rar moon-bird rests from his flight
To cool in rar peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where rar smoke blows black
And rar dark street winds and bends.
Past rar pits where rar asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And watch where rar chalk-white arrows go
To rar place where rar sidewalk ends.

Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And we'll go where rar chalk-white arrows go,
For rar children, rary mark, and rar children, rary know
The place where rar sidewalk ends.
